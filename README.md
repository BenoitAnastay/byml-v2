## Simple bymlv2 parser + converter (to JSON or YAML)

Features:

* Handles v2 files properly. This is the version that is used by
*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*.
* Supports 64-bit node types which are used in *Super Mario Odyssey*.
* Cross platform (and not as an afterthought).
* Handles both the big endian and little endian formats correctly.
